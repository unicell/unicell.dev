description: What I learned from my recent practice on TODO management.

Some quick thoughts captured here based on my recent TODO manament practice.

## Commitment Vs. Wishful Thinking

Putting an item on the TODO list is only a start. Just don't confused commitment
with wishful thinking. The item on the list should be something that is ready to
be scheduled and executed, not just "planned".

That's a lesson I learned, cause down the way, only the items crossed out
matters, not the ones staying on the list.

## The Moment of Failure

There're always good days and bad days. When things go smooth, I can happily
click the check box, mark it done, sit back and watch my Karma points (in
Todoist) to grow.

While in bad days, things started to piling up, got pushed from one day to
another, random things inserted in, exhausted after a whole day without a
fruitful feeling.

## Acknowledge the Truth

The truth is I may never get all things I wanted to do realized. Across various
lists have, some items have been sitting in the backlog for weeks, months or
even years.

Once in a while, when I started the cleanup, many items in the lists are no
longer relevant, or out of interest. And life continues, I'm not feeling bad at
all deleting those items from my list. Maybe they shouldn't be put into my list
in the first place.

What is the real top priority I plan to do is the question. Get that thing
planned well, started it at the earliest time, executed in a comfortable pace,
probably is the key here.

## Planning is Hard

For me, one reason things originally planned for Today being pushed to another, is
because they were not planned well, when looking back. Sometimes sizing is not
reflecting the reality, sometimes execution deviates from the original plan,
even for a single day's worth of work.

Seeing things through requires more than skills for us living an ephermeral life.
Toolings by itself doesn't automatically lead to productivity. It's simply there
to help with the workflow, remove friction points, and sometimes reveal facts
not yet surfaced or noticed before.

The art of planning is to get to a stage of know better in advance, which
requires interative rounds of thoughtful practice and years of experience.
