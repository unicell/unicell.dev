description: My learnings on TODO management and the tools.
---

TODO mangement is not new to me. Over the years, I've tried several
things. And yet, I still have this constant feeling that there're so many
things: study items, books, bookmarks, blog plans sitting there, in my list,
idled. Sometimes when I started cleanup, the dates on the record brutely remind
me that last update was years ago already.

This post serves mainly for my own retrospection. Hopefully can provide some
useful reference for others as well.

## Prior Art

Initially I mixed TODO management together with my knowledge management solution
(more on that in a different post). Basically in a plain text form getting
synchronized through a repository.

Obviously that was not very efficient. It was geared towards desktop working
environment and almost not suitable for any non-work related usecases.

I switched to [remember the milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/), or RTM,
shortly after, which is a TODO / task management tool with both web, desktop and
mobile versions. I was a happy user for years and especially like its colors,
keyboard shortcuts and overall look-n-feel.

But over the time, I kind of rely more on [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) than
RTM. That's mostly because random things come here and there, unstructureed.
Evernote fits better for that. It's kind of interesting, because I moved back to
a similar text based notes management solution, just picked Evernote for the
sake of sychronizability.

Evernote is not an answer to task management as well. I tried, by keeping notes in
Evernote tracking things I plan to do on bi-weekly basis. Inside a note for
bi-weekly plan, there're daily items. Since it is purely a notebook, I can keep
random notes, move text around, update the TODO item with a strikethrough etc.
The downside though, now when I look back, is that: It is a great solution
capturing thoughts, get information organized, or keeping records. It is not
however helping me to get things done.

## New Start

Tool wise, I realized I need something really lightweight that could help me
to manage TODOs on the go. For that, at least I need a product that can
synchronize across platforms (desktop, web and mobile). And for desktop version,
I need good keyboard shortcuts support: navigation, editing etc. (remember the
milk is doing perfect on that front).

Other typical features task management tool provide, for me, are nice to have,
but barely a decision point. (i.e. labels, subtasks, notifications, 3rd party
intgraions)

What I'm really looking for, with my next TODO management tool, is an
achievement system as in gaming systems. A simple thing like that will make a
difference to motivate me get things done. I learned that from my own
[Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/)

That's why I endup picking [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) as a paid user, just
for the "Productivity Trend" feature. It visualized the completed items in color
code, together with a goal setting and karma points. After a few weeks use, I do
feel it started to help me to get more things done. Actually, this blog post
itself is the very result of it. ^^

## Other Words

The tooling itself of course is not the core piece in my productivity quest. But
it plays a vital part. It probably deserves another post for the practices with
the tooling support. But here is a quick note (to myself): Try to keep a shorter
todo list and a healthy turn over rate.
