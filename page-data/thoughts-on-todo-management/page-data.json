Wishful Thinking</h2>\n<p>Putting an item on the TODO list is only a start. Just don’t confused commitment\nwith wishful thinking. The item on the list should be something that is ready to\nbe scheduled and executed, not just “planned”.</p>\n<p>That’s a lesson I learned, cause down the way, only the items crossed out\nmatters, not the ones staying on the list.</p>\n<h2>The Moment of Failure</h2>\n<p>There’re always good days and bad days. When things go smooth, I can happily\nclick the check box, mark it done, sit back and watch my Karma points (in\nTodoist) to grow.</p>\n<p>While in bad days, things started to piling up, got pushed from one day to\nanother, random things inserted in, exhausted after a whole day without a\nfruitful feeling.</p>\n<h2>Acknowledge the Truth</h2>\n<p>The truth is I may never get all things I wanted to do realized. Across various\nlists have, some items have been sitting in the backlog for weeks, months or\neven years.</p>\n<p>Once in a while, when I started the cleanup, many items in the lists are no\nlonger relevant, or out of interest. And life continues, I’m not feeling bad at\nall deleting those items from my list. Maybe they shouldn’t be put into my list\nin the first place.</p>\n<p>What is the real top priority I plan to do is the question. Get that thing\nplanned well, started it at the earliest time, executed in a comfortable pace,\nprobably is the key here.</p>\n<h2>Planning is Hard</h2>\n<p>For me, one reason things originally planned for Today being pushed to another, is\nbecause they were not planned well, when looking back. Sometimes sizing is not\nreflecting the reality, sometimes execution deviates from the original plan,\neven for a single day’s worth of work.</p>\n<p>Seeing things through requires more than skills for us living an ephermeral life.\nToolings by itself doesn’t automatically lead to productivity. It’s simply there\nto help with the workflow, remove friction points, and sometimes reveal facts\nnot yet surfaced or noticed before.</p>\n<p>The art of planning is to get to a stage of know better in advance, which\nrequires interative rounds of thoughtful practice and years of experience.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on TODO management","date":"May 29, 2020","description":"What I learned from my recent practice on TODO management."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/thoughts-on-todo-management/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/todo-management-tools/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TODO Management Tools"}},"next":null}}}
