Over the years, I’ve tried several\nthings. And yet, I still have this constant feeling that there’re so many\nthings: study items, books, bookmarks, blog plans sitting there, in my list,\nidled. Sometimes when I started cleanup, the dates on the record brutely remind\nme that last update was years ago already.</p>\n<p>This post serves mainly for my own retrospection. Hopefully can provide some\nuseful reference for others as well.</p>\n<h2>Prior Art</h2>\n<p>Initially I mixed TODO management together with my knowledge management solution\n(more on that in a different post). Basically in a plain text form getting\nsynchronized through a repository.</p>\n<p>Obviously that was not very efficient. It was geared towards desktop working\nenvironment and almost not suitable for any non-work related usecases.</p>\n<p>I switched to <a href=\"https://www.rememberthemilk.com/\">remember the milk</a>, or RTM,\nshortly after, which is a TODO / task management tool with both web, desktop and\nmobile versions. I was a happy user for years and especially like its colors,\nkeyboard shortcuts and overall look-n-feel.</p>\n<p>But over the time, I kind of rely more on <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a> than\nRTM. That’s mostly because random things come here and there, unstructureed.\nEvernote fits better for that. It’s kind of interesting, because I moved back to\na similar text based notes management solution, just picked Evernote for the\nsake of sychronizability.</p>\n<p>Evernote is not an answer to task management as well. I tried, by keeping notes in\nEvernote tracking things I plan to do on bi-weekly basis. Inside a note for\nbi-weekly plan, there’re daily items. Since it is purely a notebook, I can keep\nrandom notes, move text around, update the TODO item with a strikethrough etc.\nThe downside though, now when I look back, is that: It is a great solution\ncapturing thoughts, get information organized, or keeping records. It is not\nhowever helping me to get things done.</p>\n<h2>New Start</h2>\n<p>Tool wise, I realized I need something really lightweight that could help me\nto manage TODOs on the go. For that, at least I need a product that can\nsynchronize across platforms (desktop, web and mobile). And for desktop version,\nI need good keyboard shortcuts support: navigation, editing etc. (remember the\nmilk is doing perfect on that front).</p>\n<p>Other typical features task management tool provide, for me, are nice to have,\nbut barely a decision point. (i.e. labels, subtasks, notifications, 3rd party\nintgraions)</p>\n<p>What I’m really looking for, with my next TODO management tool, is an\nachievement system as in gaming systems. A simple thing like that will make a\ndifference to motivate me get things done. I learned that from my own\n<a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/\">Fitbit</a></p>\n<p>That’s why I endup picking <a href=\"https://todoist.com/\">Todoist</a> as a paid user, just\nfor the “Productivity Trend” feature. It visualized the completed items in color\ncode, together with a goal setting and karma points. After a few weeks use, I do\nfeel it started to help me to get more things done. Actually, this blog post\nitself is the very result of it. ^^</p>\n<h2>Other Words</h2>\n<p>The tooling itself of course is not the core piece in my productivity quest. But\nit plays a vital part. It probably deserves another post for the practices with\nthe tooling support. But here is a quick note (to myself): Try to keep a shorter\ntodo list and a healthy turn over rate.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"TODO Management Tools","date":"May 22, 2020","description":"My learnings on TODO management and the tools."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/to-do-management/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
