&lt;h2&gt;Commitment Vs. Wishful Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting an item on the TODO list is only a start. Just don’t confused commitment
with wishful thinking. The item on the list should be something that is ready to
be scheduled and executed, not just “planned”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a lesson I learned, cause down the way, only the items crossed out
matters, not the ones staying on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Moment of Failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’re always good days and bad days. When things go smooth, I can happily
click the check box, mark it done, sit back and watch my Karma points (in
Todoist) to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in bad days, things started to piling up, got pushed from one day to
another, random things inserted in, exhausted after a whole day without a
fruitful feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledge the Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is I may never get all things I wanted to do realized. Across various
lists have, some items have been sitting in the backlog for weeks, months or
even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, when I started the cleanup, many items in the lists are no
longer relevant, or out of interest. And life continues, I’m not feeling bad at
all deleting those items from my list. Maybe they shouldn’t be put into my list
in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the real top priority I plan to do is the question. Get that thing
planned well, started it at the earliest time, executed in a comfortable pace,
probably is the key here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning is Hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, one reason things originally planned for Today being pushed to another, is
because they were not planned well, when looking back. Sometimes sizing is not
reflecting the reality, sometimes execution deviates from the original plan,
even for a single day’s worth of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing things through requires more than skills for us living an ephermeral life.
Toolings by itself doesn’t automatically lead to productivity. It’s simply there
to help with the workflow, remove friction points, and sometimes reveal facts
not yet surfaced or noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of planning is to get to a stage of know better in advance, which
requires interative rounds of thoughtful practice and years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TODO Management Tools]]></title><description><![CDATA[TODO mangement is not new to me. Over the years, I’ve tried several

Over the years, I’ve tried several
things. And yet, I still have this constant feeling that there’re so many
things: study items, books, bookmarks, blog plans sitting there, in my list,
idled. Sometimes when I started cleanup, the dates on the record brutely remind
me that last update was years ago already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post serves mainly for my own retrospection. Hopefully can provide some
useful reference for others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I mixed TODO management together with my knowledge management solution
(more on that in a different post). Basically in a plain text form getting
synchronized through a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously that was not very efficient. It was geared towards desktop working
environment and almost not suitable for any non-work related usecases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rememberthemilk.com/&quot;&gt;remember the milk&lt;/a&gt;, or RTM,
shortly after, which is a TODO / task management tool with both web, desktop and
mobile versions. I was a happy user for years and especially like its colors,
keyboard shortcuts and overall look-n-feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the time, I kind of rely more on &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; than
RTM. That’s mostly because random things come here and there, unstructureed.
Evernote fits better for that. It’s kind of interesting, because I moved back to
a similar text based notes management solution, just picked Evernote for the
sake of sychronizability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evernote is not an answer to task management as well. I tried, by keeping notes in
Evernote tracking things I plan to do on bi-weekly basis. Inside a note for
bi-weekly plan, there’re daily items. Since it is purely a notebook, I can keep
random notes, move text around, update the TODO item with a strikethrough etc.
The downside though, now when I look back, is that: It is a great solution
capturing thoughts, get information organized, or keeping records. It is not
however helping me to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tool wise, I realized I need something really lightweight that could help me
to manage TODOs on the go. For that, at least I need a product that can
synchronize across platforms (desktop, web and mobile). And for desktop version,
I need good keyboard shortcuts support: navigation, editing etc. (remember the
milk is doing perfect on that front).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other typical features task management tool provide, for me, are nice to have,
but barely a decision point. (i.e. labels, subtasks, notifications, 3rd party
intgraions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m really looking for, with my next TODO management tool, is an
achievement system as in gaming systems. A simple thing like that will make a
difference to motivate me get things done. I learned that from my own
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fitbit.com/&quot;&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I endup picking &lt;a href=&quot;https://todoist.com/&quot;&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; as a paid user, just
for the “Productivity Trend” feature. It visualized the completed items in color
code, together with a goal setting and karma points. After a few weeks use, I do
feel it started to help me to get more things done. Actually, this blog post
itself is the very result of it. ^^&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooling itself of course is not the core piece in my productivity quest. But
it plays a vital part. It probably deserves another post for the practices with
the tooling support. But here is a quick note (to myself): Try to keep a shorter
todo list and a healthy turn over rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
